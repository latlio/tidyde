Description: A tidy interface for performing differential expression (DE) analysis
        on bulk-RNAseq data. Currently supports `limma`. `tidyde` makes it easy
        to work with DE analyses in a tidy and consistent manner. 
        In addition to performing DE analysis, `tidyde` also includes `ggplot2`
        geoms and common data visualizations, such as volacano plots and pca plots.
        and heatmaps.
